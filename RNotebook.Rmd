This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
airline <- read_sas("http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/sas/airline.sas7bdat", 
    NULL)

airline
```

Data wrangle
Here I wrangle my data & data viz
```{r}

airline %>%
 filter(W >= 0.68 & W <= 1.78) %>%
 filter(R >= 0.145 & R <= 0.375) %>%
 
    filter(K >= 4.7 & K <= 9.6) %>%
 ggplot() +
 aes(x = Y, y = W) +
 geom_point(size = 1L) +
 scale_color_hue() +
 theme_minimal()

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
